# PyBer Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to illustrate, in graph, weekly total ride fares based on city types (urban, suburban, and rural).

## Resources
1. Python 3.7.14
2. Jupyter Notebook 5.7.10



## Results
The total number of rides, drivers, and fares were highest in urban cities, then suburban, then rural as shown in below chart. 
However, the average fare per ride and per driver showed the opposite trend, with rural cities being more profitable than those of urban and suburban cities.

As determined by above chart, urban cities had the most number of rides and drivers, and therefore fares. Below line graph illustrates the total fare amounts on a weekly basis from January, 2019 to April, 2019, with the highest peak the last week of February across all city types.
